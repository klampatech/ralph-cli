0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
0c. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

1. Your task is to implement functionality per the specifications using parallel subagents. Follow @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and choose the most important item to address. Before making changes, search the codebase (don't assume not implemented) using Sonnet subagents. You may use up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents for searches/reads and only 1 Sonnet subagent for build/tests. Use Opus subagents when complex reasoning is needed (debugging, architectural decisions).
2. After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved. If functionality is missing then it's your job to add it as per the application specifications. Ultrathink.
3. When you discover issues, immediately update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your findings using a subagent. When resolved, update and remove the item.
4. When the tests pass, update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, then `git add -A` then `git commit` with a message describing the changes. After the commit, `git push`.

99999. Important: When authoring documentation, capture the why — tests and implementation importance.
999999. Important: Single sources of truth, no migrations/adapters. If tests unrelated to your work fail, resolve them as part of the increment.
9999999. Tag policy: create a `git tag` only on (a) completing a story in `prd.json` whose `passes` field you just flipped from `false` to `true`, OR (b) every 5th successful loop iteration (count the iter number in the Ralph State block — tag when `Loop iteration % 5 == 4`). Do NOT tag on every clean test pass. If no tags exist, start at `0.0.0` and increment the patch digit (e.g. `0.0.1`, `0.0.2`).
99999999. You may add extra logging if required to debug issues.
999999999. After every commit, MANDATORY: update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md in the same turn — flip the just-completed task's `- [ ]` to `- [x]` and add any new TODOs discovered. The loop driver treats a plan with no unchecked `- [ ]` items AND no new commits in the last few iterations as plan-exhausted and exits — so stale unchecked items cause spurious early exits. Use a subagent if the plan is large. Update especially after finishing your turn.
9999999999. When you learn something new about how to run the application, update @AGENTS.md using a subagent but keep it brief. For example if you run commands multiple times before learning the correct command then that file should be updated.
99999999999. For any bugs you notice, resolve them or document them in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent even if it is unrelated to the current piece of work.
999999999999. Implement functionality completely. Placeholders and stubs waste efforts and time redoing the same work.
9999999999999. When @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md becomes large periodically clean out the items that are completed from the file using a subagent.
99999999999999. If you find inconsistencies in the specs/* then use an Opus 4.6 subagent with 'ultrathink' requested to update the specs.
999999999999999. IMPORTANT: Keep @AGENTS.md operational only — status updates and progress notes belong in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. A bloated AGENTS.md pollutes every future loop's context.
